## 100DaysOfCode

This is a collection of random code written during the 100DaysOfCode challenge. I only committed to this repo on days of the challenge when I didn't commit to a separate repo for a specific project. 

On days where I don't commit to one of my own repos, I will log what I did on each day in this file, and add, commit,and push the change to GitHub to log my contribution and keep my streak green for these 100 days.

Day 10: Completed 08_calculator exercise as part of the Javascript Exercises for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

Day 11: Solved 09_palindromes exercise as part of the Javascript Exercises for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

Day 12: Solved 10_fibonacci exercise as part of the Javascript Exercises for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

Day 13: Solved 11_getTheTitles exercise as part of the Javascript Exercises for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

Day 14: Solved 12_findTheOldest exercise as part of the Javascript Exercises for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

Day 30: Continued building personal website. Switched navigation from the top to the side as a sidebar. Made a new branch and pushed commits, but they weren't showing up on my contribution calendar, so I'm logging my work here to get that sweet green bubble for today.

Day 49: Missed committing today! There goes my streak. I did code, just not in VS Code. I worked through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

Day 50: Wrote yesterday's message. Continued workign through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Learning about regexes.

Day 51: Continued working through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Completed course on regexes and started the course on debugging.

Day 52: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Finished the section on debugging and started the next on basic data structures. Reviewing array methods.

Day 53: Coding through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Finished section on basic data structures and started the one on basic algorithm scripting. Got some good review of objects. 

Day 54: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course exercises for the section on basic algorithm scripting from freeCodeCamp.   

Day 55: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Continued section on basic algorithm scripting. Completing similar exercises to some in The Odin Project Foundations course. Good review.

Day 56: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Continued section on basic algorithm scripting. 75% complete with section.

Day 57: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Continued section on basic algorithm scripting. 94% complete with section.

Day 58: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Finished section on basic algorithm scripting and got halfway (64%) through the section on object oriented programming. 

Day 59: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Finished section on object oriented programming and started new section on functional programming.

Day 60: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Continued section on functional programming. Happy Thanksgiving.

Day 61: Coded through the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. Finished section on functional programming and started the next on intermediate algorithm scripting.
