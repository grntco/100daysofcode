## 100DaysOfCode

This is a collection of random code written during the 100DaysOfCode challenge. I only committed to this repo on days of the challenge when I didn't commit to a separate repo for a specific project. 

On days where I don't commit to one of my own repos, I will log what I did on each day in this file, and add, commit,and push the change to GitHub to log my contribution and keep my streak green for these 100 days.
